# Microcontroller_Project_Links

Links to videos demonstrating microprocssor projects Daija created at Florida Atlantic University.  
These projects demonstrate MSP430 Microcontrollers were programmed using C/C++.  
Each video shows Daija explaining and displaying the documentation for the project and how the sensors were coded,  
and shows Daija demostrating the completed, fully functioning projects.
